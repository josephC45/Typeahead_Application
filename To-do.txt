//TODO: Python script will be needed to interact with the websocket via CLI.
//TODO: Look into how we interact with HDFS.
//TODO: How will we store popular prefixes in HDFS? (Idea: Key:Value -> word:occurrence)

Ideas:
Trie-Microservice 
-> Pulls file(s) from HDFS to create trie every 24 hours
-> CLI is used to interact with websocket to query trie for prefix/word
-> Once prefix/word has been entered via CLI, it enters Kafka -> From Kafka -> Spark ingests it

Spark-Microservice
-> Aggregates the prefixes/words based on their occurrence. (Need to determine the size of the popularprefix list found at each trie node)
-> Write output to a txt file and pushes to HDFS
